## Struggling is to be expected, especially if you are feeling unwell.

I'm struggling right now, little has been done since Day 1 due to feeling unwell. I was sleep deprived and then I got man flu. I did a Covid test, at least it was not that.  Yesterday I was feeling so unwell, I went to bed at 5pm. I was restless and got up a couple of times before finally getting to sleep around 11pm.  

Out of bed around 5.15am  I'm feeling a little better today, but still slightly "man flu".

I have been looking at other websites in the last couple of days but my energy levels only allowed me to skim read. At least I have bookmarked a few pages for later digestion. Here's some of what I've got so far.

[Teenie Wee](https://teeniewee.com/)

* The title reminds me of someone with a weak bladder and makes me chuckle.
* I looked at this site because it appears to be doing well on etsy (need to confirm) No1 under "photos" search
* Site has a shopping cart
* **Sells various art / photography prints including water colours from photos service. I can do this.**

[Fixipixi](https://fixipixi.com/)

* Love the title and it was this that inspired me to choose **Photomendy**
* Good modern design, impressive grid design highlighting services offered. **Good idea I can use**
* Not a fan of the width too wide in desktop view but the full width works very well in mobile devices, works well there. **Good idea I can use and improve on this.**
* Retouching Service page - Clear and simple "How it works" section. **Good idea I can use**
* There are more good ideas I can use in this website.  

[Photographs forever](https://www.photographsforever.co.uk/photo-restoration-services/)
* Looks simple and proffesional at first glance.
* Wording looks very good, again at first glance. 
* Services well laid out.
* Use this to inspire my ideas. 
* Simple and straight forward layout, it's a shame that it's not too good on a mobile device. Looks as though the responsive aspects have been poorly implemented.  **I can do better.**

Edit: 10/03/2022:  Feeling much better today and looking back at this now? Not bad considering I was a mess.
