<p>I&rsquo;m struggling right now, little has been done since Day 1 due to feeling unwell. I was sleep deprived and then I got man flu. I did a Covid test, at least it was not that.  Yesterday I was feeling so unwell, I went to bed at 5pm. I was restless and got up a couple of times before finally getting to sleep around 11pm.</p>
<p>Out of bed around 5.15am  I&rsquo;m feeling a little better today, but still slightly &ldquo;man flu&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I have been looking at other websites in the last couple of days but my energy levels only allowed me to skim read. At least I have bookmarked a few pages for later digestion. Here&rsquo;s some of what I&rsquo;ve got so far.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://teeniewee.com/" target="_blank">Teenie Wee</a></p>
<ul>
<li>The title reminds me of someone with a weak bladder and makes me chuckle.</li>
<li>I looked at this site because it appears to be doing well on etsy (need to confirm) No1 under &ldquo;photos&rdquo; search</li>
<li>Site has a shopping cart</li>
<li><strong>Sells various art / photography prints including water colours from photos service. I can do this.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>
<a href="https://fixipixi.com/" target="_blank">Fixipixi</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Love the title and it was this that inspired me to choose <strong>Photomendy</strong></li>
<li>Good modern design, impressive grid design highlighting services offered. <strong>Good idea I can use</strong></li>
<li>Not a fan of the width too wide in desktop view but the full width works very well in mobile devices, works well there. <strong>Good idea I can use and improve on this.</strong></li>
<li>Retouching Service page - Clear and simple &ldquo;How it works&rdquo; section. <strong>Good idea I can use</strong></li>
<li>There are more good ideas I can use in this website.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<a href="https://www.photographsforever.co.uk/photo-restoration-services/" target="_blank">Photographs forever</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Looks simple and proffesional at first glance.</li>
<li>Wording looks very good, again at first glance.</li>
<li>Services well laid out.</li>
<li>Use this to inspire my ideas.</li>
<li>Simple and straight forward layout, it&rsquo;s a shame that it&rsquo;s not too good on a mobile device. Looks as though the responsive aspects have been poorly implemented.  <strong>I can do better.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Edit: 10/03/2022:  Feeling much better today and looking back at this now? Not bad considering I was a mess.</p>
