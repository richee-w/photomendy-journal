<p>Welcome to my my first entry in this journal. As of writing, this idea was born a month or two ago.  Simple idea, provide image editing services for anyone who needs it.  Photographers, artists and entrepreneurs are the first type of people I have thought of and I feel there are probably many other industries that may benefit from such services.</p>
<p>My approach is to start with something simple and to make a little pocket money to start with and later turn into something I can earn a living with.  The first service I shall offer is photography restoration, I have the Photoshop skills to do this to a high standard.  A short while ago I was telling a friend about my idea and she immediately asked me to do a job for her. The restoration was a complete success and my friend was delighted with the result.  It&rsquo;s a beautiful thing to see someone happy with your work.</p>
<p>So where to start? Well that’s the question that’s been on my mind since the conception of this idea. Initially it was write a website, listing my services, make it look a little fancy, etc…</p>
<p>I asked my cousin Andrew, a life coach if we could chat about my idea.  We had as good hour or so chat via zoom and he found no major glitches to my thoughts, so finding reasons to be positive.</p>
<p>First task? Set up this journal, check.</p>
<p>Next task? Check out the websites of my competitors. Look at their content to get some ideas on how I am going to present my web site, then get building.</p>
