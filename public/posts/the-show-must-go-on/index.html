Despite this I am still not feeling the best, I blame Putin. Not joking, just as the world is looking like it&rsquo;s over the worse of Covid, Putin invades Ukraine.

<p>I try to take a stoic approach, easier said than done, but here goes.  There is no point worrying over things I have no control over but instead I can focus on what I can do to make life better. This eventually leads me to the conclusion, &ldquo;The show must go on&rdquo; as in the &ldquo;Photomendy&rdquo; show. The hope is that the &ldquo;show&rdquo; will earn me enough money to pay the energy bills and still have enough left over to enjoy life.</p>
<p>So, to get back on track.  This morning I self hosted this journal on my server and had some thoughts on how to overcome my bouts of depression which threaten to end this project by me giving up.  Patience is not my greatest virtue and it needs to improve.  I&rsquo;ve noticed how frustrated I become when jobs take so much longer than I anticipate or when a web search for a simple solution to a problem becomes a rabbit hole of time consumption.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also noticed a lack of frustration when working on a project with no particular direction or time constraint other than doing said project for the fun of it.  I believe the way to overcome all this is to remember that I have given myself a year to get this project up and running and although I may not meet my small &ldquo;S.M.A.R.T.&rdquo; deadlines, it&rsquo;s no reason to despair.  Look at those deadlines as desirable targets, but it&rsquo;s not a big deal if I miss them as long as I keep working towards the goal.</p>
<p>The next step is to make the website, for which my first thought was to have it done over a weekend.  This simply did not happen and I have been swapping and changing my mind over how to approach this with getting nothing done.  The initial approach was to use hugo, a static website builder, but there is a learning curve to this.  After speaking with Andrew, it appeared wiser to simply go with what I know and use Wordpress to speed up the process of making the website.</p>
<p>I got started with Wordpress but was hating every moment of working with this bloated solution, it was a drag.  I changed my mind to build a static site by using straight HTML and CSS but I go nowhere fast, my skills are very rusty in this department.</p>
<p>I’ve now decided I am going back to my initial solution and just do the learning curve. I am going to use the hugo static web builder as I believe the benefits outweigh the disadvantages.  The main disadvantage being the time it takes to get through the learning curve. The benefits are as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning something new.</li>
<li>It’s something I’ve wanted to learn for over a year</li>
<li>The new skill could be an earner in the future</li>
<li>Learning as I go with a tangible product made when done</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m going to allow myself 3 months to do this.  It seems a very long time to get a simple website up and running, but I believe it will be worth it.  Even though I’m not the best web developer (I feel a total imposter calling myself a “web developer”) I believe I can make a better looking website than my competitors.</p>
<p>Andrew said not to get bogged down with the website, I know he meant well but I think it will be an important and fundamental aspect of my marketing, so I believe it’s worth the time and effort.</p>
<p>The next task is to break down leaning hugo and building the website into manageable chunks.</p>
